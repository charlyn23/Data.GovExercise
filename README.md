# Data.GovExercise
Practice with parsing, libraries and various Android tools and techniques.

The assignment began with parsing data from a data.gov resourse and shown on-screen.

Next, I added an animate pie chart to show population numbers. I also switched from a runnable flow to Asynch Task.
I will continue to build on this as further specifications are released.
